Overview
This project implements a Linear Regression Model to predict house prices based on key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The model is built and trained using Python, with libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn. This project is ideal for beginners in machine learning and serves as a practical demonstration of how regression techniques are applied in real-world scenarios.
